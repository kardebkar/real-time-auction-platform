1. Mobile App Authentication
typescript// Login screen pre-populated with test credentials
Email: admin@auction.com
Password: password123
2. Create an Active Auction
```
graphqlmutation {
  createAuction(input: {
    title: "Test Mobile Bidding"
    description: "Testing real-time mobile bidding"
    startingPrice: 50
    startTime: "2024-06-19T00:00:00.000Z"  # Past date = ACTIVE

    images: ["https://via.placeholder.com/300x200"]
  }) {
    id
    title
    status  # Will be ACTIVE
    currentPrice
  }
}
```
4. Place a Bid (Mobile or GraphQL)
```
graphqlmutation {
  placeBid(input: {
    auctionId: "YOUR_AUCTION_ID"
